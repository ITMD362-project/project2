Redesigning the Yale Art School page

1. For the current Home page: 
The picture kind of speaks for itself, there is so much happening. The title(school name) just looks like plain text. The background is a repeated portrait view image of a chair and all of the content is all cluttered to the left. The navigation and login pages are kind of difficult to find off first glance and there are so many clashing colors. The address is also in such an unnecessary spot, above all of the main content. It is really unorganized as each of the different sections barely have any spacing between them, making it difficult to read through.
- Changes: First, to fix the colors, we decided to minimize it to the school's color, blue, with a white background to make it easy to read. Additionally, instead of keeping all of the text sections cluttered to the left we "spread" it all down, allowing the user to read it easier (and normally). With these sections we separated them with a divider to keep it organized. We also moved the navigation to the top, to make it easy to access and see. The address has also been moved to the bottom of the page and enlarged. Lastly, we have the school name/title dead center and a lot bigger.

2. Current Publication Page:
Similar to the home page, there is unnecessary repeated images (they are actually gifs) for the background and the content is still on the left. The title of the page and subtitles do not look like they are of their role and again, there are lots of clashing colors. Since everything is squished to the left, the abundance of text in the description makes the boxes seem cluttered.
- Redesigned Publication Page: Instead of limiting the publications to a small box, we have them in their own section, organized by a divider. We also removed the publication title and subtitle as it will be intuitive with the new navigation bar. Additionally, we adjusted the colors to the new primary color. 

3. Current Application Page:
In this application page, there is no form seem to be found... It is all text and contains unnecessary information that should not be in the application page, but rather a "More Info" or "FAQ" section. Again, the colors and the repeated image/gifs background are quite overstimulating.
- Redesigned Application Page: In this redesigned page we have a form, and have made the page a lot more minimalistic, but aesthetically pleasing too, keeping the main theme of properly centering our content and using new primary colors.
